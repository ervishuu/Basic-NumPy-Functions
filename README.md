>What is NumPy?

NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.

It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains various features

It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.

NumPy stands for Numerical Python.

>Why is NumPy Faster Than Lists?

NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.

>Which Language is NumPy written in?

NumPy is a Python library and is written partially in Python, but most of the parts that require fast computation are written in C or C++. 2005
